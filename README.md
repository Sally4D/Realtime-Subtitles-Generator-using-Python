## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Could not capture audio"
- **Solution**: Check that your system has audio output devices
- **Windows**: Ensure "Stereo Mix" or similar loopback device is enabled
- **macOS**: Grant microphone permissions in System Preferences
- **Linux**: Install and configure PulseAudio or ALSA

#### "Model not found" error
- **Solution**: Open Settings ‚Üí Select your language ‚Üí Wait for automatic download
- **Manual**: Download models from [Vosk Models](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models)

#### Translation not working
- **Solution**: 
  - Check that translation is enabled in Settings
  - Verify target language is selected
  - Wait for translation model download to complete
  - Try switching translation backends (ArgosTranslate ‚Üî MarianMT)

#### Poor translation quality
- **Solution**:
  - Try MarianMT backend for higher quality (if language pair supported)
  - Ensure clear audio input for better source transcription
  - Check that source language matches the speech recognition setting

#### "Translation model download failed"
- **Solution**:
  - Check internet connection
  - Try different language pair
  - Switch to alternative translation backend
  - Manually install models if needed

#### Application slow with translation
- **Solution**:
  - Use ArgosTranslate for better performance
  - Increase block size for less frequent processing
  - Close other resource-intensive applications
  - Consider using smaller translation models

### Performance Optimization
- **For speed**: Use ArgosTranslate, smaller models, lower block sizes
- **For accuracy**: Use MarianMT, larger models, higher block sizes  
- **For battery life**: Disable translation when not needed, use smaller models
